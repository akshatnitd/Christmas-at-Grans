# Christmas at Gran's

"Christmas at Gran's" is a poem written by Michael Brennan at the age of ten. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, 
Brennan was forced to return to England from his home of many years, Dublin. It is here that the Author of this 
site, Conor Carroll, resides. Carroll, on the side, is an artist and illustrator, and decided to create this site 
as a homage to his friend. 

The pair are aligned in the belief that there can never too many stories in the world, and so pushing this poem 
to the greater reaches of the internet is not just a present for a friend, but a light-hearted form of digital story 
telling. The resulting piece is aimed to be age appropriate, approachable, and enjoyable, while being completely accessible 
to all audiences.
